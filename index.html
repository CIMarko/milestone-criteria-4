                                <p><strong>To achieve merit, learners need to meet the assessment criteria outlined above for a pass and a merit.</strong></p>
                                <p>The following additional guidance describes characteristics of performance at MERIT.</p>
                                <p>The learner has a clear rationale for the development of this project and has produced a fully functioning, well-documented, relational database backed, Full Stack application for a real-life audience, with a full set of CRUD (create, reading, updating and deletion of data records) features. Data validation, API handling, and user feedback are all evident in the code and the working application. Templates have been used correctly to produce working features. There are no logic errors in the code and the application functions as expected.</p>
                                <p>The finished project has a clear, well-defined purpose addressing the needs of a particular target audience (or multiple related audiences) and a particular data domain. Its purpose would be immediately evident to a new user without having to look at supporting documentation. The user is kept informed of progress and actions through feedback and, where large data sets are being loaded, progress indicators.</p>
                                <p>The design of the web application follows the principles of UX design and accessibility guidelines, and the site is fully responsive.</p>
                                <p>Data is fully modelled and matches the schema. The schema design is documented in the README. Data store configuration is kept in a single location and can be changed easily. Configuration and settings files are well-organized, and there are different versions for different branches.</p>
                                <p>Code is well-organized and easy to follow, and the application has been fully tested, following a test-driven development approach and a planned testing procedure, with no obvious errors left in the code. The development process is clearly evident through detailed commit messages. The project’s documentation provides a clear rationale for the development of this project and covers all stages of the development life cycle.</p>
                                <p>The application is robust and deals with external errors gracefully (user input, API calls, asynchronous processes).</p>
                                <p>The conventions of the framework are followed, and code is clearly separated with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Python being kept in separate, linked files.</p>
                                <p>All logic in the app makes sense in the context of its purpose (e.g., if different users have different permissions, then their access levels are appropriate so that, for example, a non-admin user will not be able to edit another user’s data).</p>

                                <p><strong>Characteristics of performance at DISTINCTION:</strong></p>
        
                                <p>The learner has documented a clear, justified, rationale for a real-world application and a comprehensive explanation of how it will be developed. The development of the project has resulted in a fully-functioning, interactive, Full Stack Django application, with well-designed data and a full set of CRUD operations. The learner shows a clear understanding of data modelling techniques and of the relationship between the Back end and Front end.</p>
        
                                <p>The finished project is judged to be publishable in its current form with a professional grade user interface and functionality, and interaction adhering to current practice. There are no logic errors in the code. Where there is a clear breach of accepted design/UX principles, or of accepted good practice in code organisation, these are fully justified, appropriate, and acceptable to the target user. It clearly matches the design and demonstrates the characteristics of craftsmanship in the code. The database schema is representative of complex user stories and there is a fully documented and full set of data operations which are fit for purpose in relation to the domain. The resulting application is original and not a copy of any walkthrough projects encountered in the unit.</p>

                                <p><strong>Front end Design</strong></p>
                                <p>The design of the web application demonstrates the main principles of good UX design:</p>
                                
                                <p><strong>Information Hierarchy</strong></p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Semantic markup is used to convey structure - all information displayed on the site is presented in an organised fashion with each piece of information being easy to find.</li>
                                    <li>All resources on the site are easy to find, allowing users to navigate the layout of the site intuitively.</li>
                                    <li>Information is presented and categorised in terms of its priority.</li>
                                </ul>
        
                                <p><strong>User Control</strong></p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>All interaction with the site would be likely to produce a positive emotional response within the user. This is due to the flow of information layout, use of colour, clear and unambiguous navigation structures, and all interaction feedback.</li>
                                    <li>When displaying media files, the site avoids aggressive automatic pop-ups and autoplay of audio; instead letting the user initiate and control such actions.</li>
                                    <li>Users who direct to a non-existent page or resource are redirected back to the main page without having to use the browser navigation buttons.</li>
                                    <li>Users are never asked for information that the application already has (e.g., a contact form does not ask a logged-in user for an email address).</li>
                                    <li>The user is shown progress indicators and feedback on transactions.</li>
                                    <li>Errors resulting from user or data actions are reported to the user.</li>

                                <p><strong>Confirmation</strong></p>
                                <p>User and data actions are confirmed where appropriate, and feedback is given at all times.</p>
        
                                <p><strong>Accessibility</strong></p>
                                <p>There is clear conformity to accessibility guidelines across all pages/sections and in all interactivity.</p>
                                <p>Any design decisions that contravene accepted user interaction, user experience design principles are identified and described (comments in code and/or a section in the README).</p>

                                    <li>File names, class names, function names, and variable names are descriptive and consistent.</li>
                                    <li>For cross-platform compatibility, file and directory names will not have spaces in them and will be lower-case only.</li>
                                    <li>All HTML attributes, CSS rules, code variables, and function names are consistent in format, follow standards for the language, and are appropriate and meaningful.</li>
                                    <li>App URLs are consistent.</li>

                                    <li>Whenever relevant, files are grouped in directories by file type (e.g., an assets directory will contain all static files and code may be organised into subdirectories such as CSS, JavaScript, etc).</li>
                                    <li>There is a clear separation between custom code and any external files (e.g., library files are all inside a directory named 'libraries').</li>
                                    <li>Files are named consistently and descriptively, without spaces or capitalisation to allow for cross-platform compatibility.</li>

                                    <li>ID/class (CSS and JavaScript)/function/variable names clearly indicate their purpose.</li>
                                    <li>All code is split into well-defined and commented sections.</li>

                                    <li>CSS files are linked in the HTML file’s head element.</li>
                                    <li>Non-trivial JavaScript code files are linked at the bottom of the body element (or bottom of head element if it needs to be loaded before the body HTML).</li>
                                </ul>

                                        <li>any functionality requiring log-in is available only to logged-in users</li> 
                                    <li> user permissions and levels of access are appropriate (e.g. a non-admin user would
                                        not be able to edit another user’ post)
                                        </li>

                                    <li>Placing of logic in the most appropriate components demonstrates an understanding of the Model-View-Controller (Template) pattern.</li>
                                    <li>Configuration and settings files are well-organised.</li>
